<p>The obama operation is a go, remember this information can't be leaked anywhere.
We can't let the outside world know what's going on..
If they found out about this shit, the world could fall apart for all we know!
As long as we keep things under the rug no one needs to know about this, we have to keep the public safe.

<p>But why are we creating fabricated images? wouldn't it just be easier if we should them the real deal?

<p>The real deal? do you know what could happen?? because I don't their is no telling..
If these documents get in the wrong hands who knows what could happen?
I just hope we don't have a mole in here, you know what happened the last time chat logs got leaked?

<p>Yeah, we had to kill that small village, sad that we couldn't keep them alive.

<p>Ok well think about that but now on an international scale..
We can't just keep hiding these things..

<p>I understand, I just hope one day we can say something.. that is true..
-- AnonBerry35 [16:12 10/1/23]</p>

<p>We will, it's just not time yet..
